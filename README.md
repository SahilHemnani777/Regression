# Regression
## Simple Linear Regression

Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line, while logistic and nonlinear regression models use a curved line. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables.
